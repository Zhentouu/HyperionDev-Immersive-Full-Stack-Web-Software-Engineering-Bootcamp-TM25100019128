Algorithm 1:

create num_list

loop:
  (number) = request number

  if (number) not 0 or less than 0:
    append (number) to (num_list)

  elif (number) less than 0:
    print "Please enter a positive number"

  else:
    exit

sort (num_list) largest to smallest
(largest_num) = first (number) in (num_list)
print "(largest_num)"

exit



Algorithm 2:

first_name = request first name

print "(first_name) Hello, World."

exit



Algorithm 3:

request (num_list)

for (num) in (list):
  (num_total) = (num_total) + (num)

(average) = (num_total) / (length of num_list)

print "Your average is (average)."

exit



Algorithm 4:

request (grocery_list)

sort (grocery_list) A to Z

for (grocery) in (grocery_list):
  if (grocery) are still left to buy:
    print "(grocery)"

exit



Algorithm 5:

(X) = request number
(Y) = request number

(S) = (X) + (Y)

(A) = (S) / 2

(P) = (X) x (Y)

print "(S)"
print "(A)"
print "(P)"

exit
